"""Generate the backend lockfiles.

``requirements.txt`` pins only the direct runtime dependencies and
``requirements-dev.txt`` pins the direct test/lint tooling. This script resolves
the full dependency closure of each with pip's dry-run report and writes exact
pins for every transitive package, so a fresh clone installs a byte-for-byte
reproducible tree.

Usage (from the ``backend`` directory)::

    python scripts/generate_lockfile.py          # requirements.lock
    python scripts/generate_lockfile.py --dev    # requirements-dev.lock

Verify a clean install with::

    python -m venv /tmp/verify && /tmp/verify/bin/pip install -r requirements.lock

``pip-compile`` from pip-tools (pinned in requirements-dev.txt) is the
conventional alternative::

    pip-compile --output-file=requirements.lock requirements.txt

The output is intentionally free of timestamps so re-running it produces no diff
unless a dependency actually changed.
